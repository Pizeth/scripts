# Stream Etiquette

If you're watching a VTuber stream in Japanese or another language
you don't understand, here's a quick guide to not looking like an ass.

## The Short Version

* **Have common sense**
* **Have common courtesy**

## The Medium Version

* **Have common sense**
  * The streamer can't understand you, so saying "Do this!" or "Say this!" is pointless.
  * Live streams do not have subtitles. I should not have to explain this.
* **Have common courtesy**
  * Even if the streamer could understand you, saying "Do this!" or "Say this!" is obnoxious.
  * Stay on topic. Don't chat about your personal life or other VTubers.
  * Don't spam.

## The Long Version

**The short version is all you need, as long as you actually follow it.**
But there are some points that could benefit from more detail or clarification:

### So how do I communicate with the streamer?

If you follow the above rules and are polite, a kind person in chat might translate for you.
If you don't follow the above rules and act like an ass, expect to be ignored.
Either way, there might be no translators in chat, or the translators might want to focus on the stream.
Again, common courtesy: don't pester them, and don't spam translation requests.

It's also possible that the streamer can understand *simple* phrases in English.
If you just want to tell them "Cute!" or "Cool!" or "Good job!" then you can probably
get your message across.

Regardless, the streamer is not your trained monkey. This applies to all streamers,
not just VTubers. Don't pester them to say things or do things for your amusement.
Even if they're doing something wrong in a game and you absolutely *must* tell them
the correct way... don't. The Japanese viewers have almost certainly already said it,
and if the streamer missed their comments, there's no way they're going to read
your comment in a language they don't understand.

### If the streamer can't understand me, why do I have to stay on topic?

Aside from what I said in the previous section, you should stay on topic because:

1. it's the not-asshole thing to do
2. it creates a good environment for other English-speakers who are watching

Even if someone is just lurking in chat or watching the VOD, it's a much nicer experience
to see other English-speaking fans enjoying and talking about *what's happening in the stream*,
and *not* their lunch or that game of Apex they played yesterday.

On the other hand, if other viewers see you using chat as your personal Twitter or spamming memes,
they'll decide it's okay for them to do the same, and you've ruined the experience for everyone
trying to enjoy the stream, regardless of the language they speak, including the streamer themselves.

I also shouldn't have to tell you that it's *very* rude to come into a streamer's chat and
start talking about a different streamer. Not only is it disrespectful to the streamer,
if people wanted to talk about another streamer, they would be in *their* chat, not here.

It's also worth mentioning that some streamers check their own VODs after the stream is
over so they can read chat in detail. Who knows? They might be using Google translate to read
comments in other languages. I've even seen streamers pause to plug a comment into Google translate
live. So chat with that in mind.

### "Just a random English comment passing through"

It's a relatively minor offense in the grand scheme of things... but please don't do this.
It spam that contributes nothing. In the same vein, "I don't even understand this, why am
I here?" That's a good question. Why *are* you here?

I understand that it can be lonely in chat if it feels like nobody else speaks your language.
If it's before the stream or right at the start, it's okay to ask, *once*, "Are there any
other English speakers here?"

This does *not* mean spam it, and it does *not* mean messages like "WHERE THE ENGLISH GANG AT!?!?"
"AM I THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO SPEAKS ENGLISH!?!?!?" "LOL I DON'T READ MOON" "SPEAK ENGLISH YOU GUYS"
